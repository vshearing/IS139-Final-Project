    <h1>The Books and Tablets Mission Statement</h1>
    <img src="Assets/Images/noteBook.jpg" alt="" class="irregularWrap" />
    <p>Books and Tablets provides high quality education and choice of learning: virtually or in-person
      for students in grades 8 through 12.
    </p>
    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
    <p>At Books and Tablets we believe that all children are unique and must have a stimulating educational
       environment where they can grow physically, mentally, emotionally, and socially. It is our desire to
       create this type of atmosphere where students can meet their full potential. We will provide a safe
       environment where students are invited to share their ideas and take risks.</p>
   <p>We believe that there are five essential elements that are conducive to learning. (1) The teacher's
     role is to act as a guide. (2) Students must have access to hands-on activities. (3) Students should
     be able to have choices and let their curiosity direct their learning. (4) Students need the opportunity
      to practice skills in a safe environment. (5) Technology must be incorporated into the school day."  </p>
    <h2> Why Choose Books and Tablets? </h2>
    <p>The Books and Tablets is a flexible learning environment that blends in-person and virtual learning.
      We strive to give our students the best education possible that fits their learning styles.
      Here are a few things that set us apart:  </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Small Class Size</strong> Most of our classes have 10-12 students.</li>
        <li><strong>Highly Qualified Instructors</strong> Our staff includes young, energetic innovative teachers as well as
        some of the most experienced and respected instructors in the area. </li>
        <li><strong>Peer Support</strong> Our peer mentoring and support system helps new students become part of our
          community and helps the older students develop leadership skills. </li>
        <li><strong>Community Outreach</strong> We have extensive ties with the community through service projects,
        character education, community events, etc. </li>
        <li><strong>Open Campus Policy</strong> Our students can leave campus for lunch, they also have study hour
          embedded into the school day for academic support, labs, tutoring and other tasks.</li>
